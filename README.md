Gait-Analysis-using-RGB-data
============================
This is our project we completed over Gait Recognition in the month of May 2014.

This work is focused on identifying a person with the help of his walking style by only collecting the rgb data.
This helps us to perform Gait Recognition with help of simple cameras, web cams without aid of infrared sensors,etc.
We also achieved a tremendous success in our results as the accuracy of result was much higher as compared to earlier works over it.
